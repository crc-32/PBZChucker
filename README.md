# PBZChucker

## What it is
An (incomplete) Android app to install Pebble PBZ firmware files.

## How it does it
Pretends to be a working companion app but then betrays the Pebble's trust and uploads firmware.

## What it needs to be
A full lightweight firmware flasher that can be independent of any other apps.

## Requirements
### Build
I strongly suggest just using the pre-signed releases, but the app has no special requirements that don't come pre-installed with Android Studio
